## About AdventJS

Where can I participate?
If you are interested in participating, every day of December a new challenge is unlocked at 18h (Spanish Peninsular Time). You can access the challenges in [Adventjs.dev](https://adventjs.dev) and you can also collaborate with the community in the [@midudev](https://twitter.com/midudev) [Discord](https://t.co/XruHkD62j3).

What is AdventJs?
AdventJs is an initiative created by the Web Development content creator [@midudev](https://twitter.com/midudev), where during 24 days daily challenges will be revealed for the community to solve.

These challenges can be solved using both ```Javascript``` and ```Typescript``` and will have a difficulty that will vary depending on the day.

What is this repository about?
This repository is created to collect my solutions to each of the challenges for the duration of this initiative, in order to help other members of the community or to receive feedback on my own solutions from other members of the community.

Are these the best possible solutions to each of the challenges?
Not at all, this is just my contribution as someone who is starting his career in programming, so it is possible that the solutions are not the best possible for each challenge.

Where to find more about the community?
You can follow midudev on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/midudev) You can also watch his live streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/midudev). (Mon-Thurs at 20h regular times, may change) or on his [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/midudev). channel You can also join his community on [Discord](https://t.co/XruHkD62j3).
